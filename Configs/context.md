# Configuration Context Guide

## Purpose

This document serves as a guide for understanding the context and patterns of configuration requests in this workspace. It helps maintain consistency and understanding across different technology configurations.

## Configuration Patterns

### 1. Technology Organization

- Each technology gets its own directory under `Configs/`
- Technology directories follow a consistent structure:
  - `.logos/` - Technology-specific logos
  - `terraform/` - Infrastructure as Code
  - `ansible/` - Configuration Management
  - `README.md` - Documentation

### 2. Documentation Requirements

- Each technology's README must include:
  - Quick Start Guide
  - Configuration Guide
  - Detailed Configuration Guide
  - Security Best Practices
  - Troubleshooting Guide
  - Support Information

### 3. Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)

- Follow provider-specific best practices
- Include required resources and configurations
- Document all variables and outputs
- Maintain security best practices

### 4. Configuration Management (Ansible)

- Use appropriate modules for the technology
- Include required configurations
- Follow security best practices
- Document all variables and options

## Previous Configurations

### Palo Alto Networks

- Purpose: Network security and automation
- Components:
  - VM-Series Firewall deployment
  - Required configurations
  - Security best practices
  - Integration with cloud providers

## Common Requirements

1. Security-first approach
2. Comprehensive documentation
3. Best practices adherence
4. Clear configuration structure
5. Troubleshooting guidance
6. Support information

## Future Considerations

When adding new technology configurations:

1. Follow established patterns
2. Include all required components
3. Document thoroughly
4. Consider security implications
5. Provide clear guidance
6. Include troubleshooting steps

## Notes

- This context guide should be updated as new patterns emerge
- Each technology may have specific requirements beyond this guide
- Security and best practices should always be prioritized
